============

Ever needed a way to express time differences in your code, like "518238s" or "166h23m14s" in a more human-readable, sensible format?
Well, look no further.

This library does just that. It takes an amount of time in seconds (like the difference between two UNIX timestamps) and converts it into a readable string.
