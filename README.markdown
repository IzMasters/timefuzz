Summary
============

Ever needed a way to express times or time differences, like "166h 23m 14s" or "between 2012-03-24 13:37 UTC and now" in a more human-readable, easily recognizable way? Well, look no further.

This python script does just that. It takes an amount of time in seconds (like the difference between two UNIX timestamps) and converts it into a readable string.
